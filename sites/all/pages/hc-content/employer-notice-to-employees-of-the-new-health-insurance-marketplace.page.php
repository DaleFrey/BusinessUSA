Under the Affordable Care Act, employers covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (generally, those 
firms that have at least one employee and at least $500,000 in annual dollar volume of business), must 
provide notification to their employees about the new Health Insurance Marketplace; inform employees 
that they may be eligible for a premium tax credit if they purchase coverage through the Marketplace; 
and advise employees that if they employee purchase a plan through the Marketplace, they may lose 
the employer contribution (if any) to any health benefits plan offered by the employer. Employers are 
required to provide this notice to all current employees by October 1, 2013, and to each new employee 
at the time of hire beginning <b>October 1, 2013</b>, regardless of plan enrollment status (if applicable) or of 
part-time or full-time status. The Department of Labor has provided employers with two sample notices 
they may use to comply with this rule, one for <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/FLSAwithoutplans.pdf">
employers who do not offer</a> a health plan and another for 
<a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/FLSAwithplans.pdf">employers who offer a health plan</a> 
for some or all employees. For more information refer to
