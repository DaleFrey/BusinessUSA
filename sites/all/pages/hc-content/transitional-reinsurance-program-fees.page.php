The Transitional Reinsurance Program</a> is a three-year program, beginning in 2014 
and continuing until 2016, that reimburses insurers in the individual insurance 
Marketplaces for high claims costs.  The program is funded through fees to be paid 
by employers (for self-insured plans) and insurers (for insured plans).  HHS 
estimates that the fees for 2014 will be $5.25 a month (or $63 for the year) for each 
individual covered under a health care plan, with the required fee for the following two 
years to be somewhat lower.  The fee applies to all employer-sponsored plans 
providing major medical coverage, including retiree programs.  The U.S. Department 
of Labor has advised that for self-insured plans, these fees can be paid from plan assets. 
The IRS has stated that the fees are tax deductible for employers.  The U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services is expected to provide more information in 
the near future clarifying the details of this program.
