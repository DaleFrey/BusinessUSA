Beginning January 2013 (applicable to 2012 reporting), most employers must report the aggregate annual 
cost of employer-provided coverage for each employee on the Form W-2.  The new W-2 reporting 
requirement is informational only and it does not require taxation on any health plan coverage.  Reporting 
is required for most employer-sponsored health coverage, including group medical coverage. <b>Small 
Employer Exception:</b> For 2012 reporting and beyond until further guidance is issued, the W-2 reporting 
requirement does not apply to employers required to file fewer than 250 Form W-2s in the prior calendar 
year.  To learn more about the requirements, as well as exclusions, visit this page at IRS.gov.
