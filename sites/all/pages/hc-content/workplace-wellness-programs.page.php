The Affordable Care Act creates new incentives to promote employer wellness 
programs and encourage employers to take more opportunities to support 
healthier workplaces. Health-contingent wellness programs generally require 
individuals to meet a specific standard related to their health to obtain a reward, 
such as programs that provide a reward to employees who don’t use, or 
decrease their use of, tobacco, and programs that reward employees who 
achieve a specified level or lower cholesterol. Under final rules that take effect 
on January 1, 2014, the maximum reward to employers using a health-contingent 
wellness program will increase from 20 percent to 30 percent of the cost of 
health coverage. Additionally, the maximum reward for programs designed to 
prevent or reduce tobacco use will be as much as 50 percent. The final rules 
also allow for flexibility in the types of wellness programs employers can offer.
