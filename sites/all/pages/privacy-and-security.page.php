<h2>Use of Persistent Cookies</h2><br/>
<br/>
Like many websites, Business.USA.gov uses "persistent cookie" technology. A persistent cookie is a small text file that this website places on your computer so that it can remember you when you show up again later—kind of like cookie crumbs! (Hence the name.) We use persistent cookies to enhance your experience on Business.USA.gov while also protecting your privacy. To get aggregate metrics on site usage to understand how people are using the site and how we can make it better. We use web metrics services to track activity on Business.USA.gov. Government agencies only ever receive traffic statistics anonymously and in the aggregate.<br/>
<br/>
Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although we think using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don't want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser's options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit; <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml" title="Opt-out of persistent cookies">here's how to disable cookies</a>.<br/>

<h2>If You Provide Us Personal Information</h2>
We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to your requests.

If you choose to provide us with personal information we use that information to respond to your message, and to help get you the information you requested. <br/>
We only share the information you give us with another Government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise as required by law.  Business.USA.gov never shares information with other entities for commercial marketing.<br/>
<br/>
